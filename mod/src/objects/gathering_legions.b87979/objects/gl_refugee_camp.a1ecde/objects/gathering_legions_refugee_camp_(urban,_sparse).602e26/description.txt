This map is meant as a pre-made option for players of the Gathering Legions campaign: Occupation of the Holy City. This map was intended to be used for the Refugee Camp location. It can be used for Pilgrim's Path, or the North and South Slums locations if about four buildings are added to represent a moderate terrain density.
