# Table Top Simulator Mod for Star Wars: Legion

**STATUS**: _WIP_. We are still setting up this repository, pardon our dust.

This project is a community-contributed open source mod for [Table Top Simulator][1],
emulating some features and gameplay of [Star Wars Legion][2]. It is periodically updated
to the [Steam Workshop][3], and in the future we will have a documented release schedule
and policy as part of the [Wiki][4].

_Star Wars: Legion and all related properties and text are owned by Fantasy Flight Games, Lucasfilm Ltd., and/or Disney._

## Background

The TTS SWL Mod was created and is maintained by one person, [Tieren][5], but as the
anticipated future workload will grow beyond the reasonable capabilities of a single person
and to ensure Tierens future commitment and enjoyment in contributing to the mod, the aim of
this project will be to move the mod to open source and allow the community to contribute to
the continued development of the mod.

## Goals

1. A community site (this site) is provided and accepting bugs/requests
2. Resources used by the mod are hosted on community accessible services
3. Mod is developed and distributed from the hosted services by the community
4. A Wiki is provided with tutorials, how-to contribute, and more

## Work In Progress

The following steps are being used to determine the readiness of this project:

* [x] Setup issue templates
* [ ] Community members are able to file and collaborate on issues
* [ ] A Wiki is setup to document the steps to contribute to the mod
* [ ] Source code "source of truth" moves into this repository
* [ ] Releases are being made directly from this repository
